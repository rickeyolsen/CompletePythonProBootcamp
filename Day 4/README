# Rock Paper Scissors

### Instructions
Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

I was given a python file consisting of only the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: rock, paper, and scissors.

I was instructed to start the game by asking the player:
"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."

From there I had to write code to solve for the following scenarios:

How will I store the user's input.
How will I generate a random choice for the computer.
How will I compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
And also how will I give feedback to the player.
